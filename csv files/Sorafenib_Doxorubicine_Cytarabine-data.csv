A Phase II Study of BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) in Metastatic  Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00090545)
 ,First Stage - Disease Progression,Second Stage - Increased Accrual
 ,The first stage was to rule out the probability of 4 month progression free survival. Patients were given 400 mg BAY 43-9006 orally twice daily in 28 day cycles.,Due to prostatic specific antigen and radiographic discordance during the first stage the protocol was amended to allow accrual to a second stage. 400 mg BAY 43-9006 orally twice daily in 28 day cycles.

 ,BAY 43-9006 & Cetuximab
 ,BAY 43-9006: Administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice a day (BID) BAY 43-9006: is a potent inhibitor of proto-oncogene c-Raf (c-raf) and wild-type and mutant proto-oncogene b-Raf (b-raf) in vitro. Cetuximab will be given intravenously (IV) at a dose of 400 mg/m^2 initially as a loading dose on week 2 followed by 250 mg/m^2 weekly starting on week 3. Cetuximab is a recombinant human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody which binds specifically to the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (HER1) c-ErbB) in normal and tumor cells and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands such as transforming growth factor-alpha.

Sorafenib for Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Esophageal and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00917462)
 ,Sorafenib
 ,Sorafenib for patients with metastatic or recurrent esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer. Sorafenib administered orally: Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily administered continuously. Patients will continue on treatment until progression of disease. Each cycle consists of 28 days. The cycle start date will coincide with the physician visit date. Because of the potential need for physician visit scheduling to vary (due to both physician and patient issues) to avoid violation of and deviation from the protocol these visits may vary by up to one to fourteen (1-14) days. A study diary will be completed by patients to ensure compliance with the study drug.

Phase III Trial Comparing Capecitabine in Combination With Sorafenib or Placebo in the Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic HER2-Negative Breast Cancer(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01234337)
 ,Sorafenib (Nexavar BAY43-9006) + Capecitabine,Placebo + Capecitabine
 ,Sorafenib tablets were administered orally continuously at a total daily dose of 600 mg (200 mg in the morning 400 mg in the evening) in a 3-week cycle. Capecitabine was administered orally at a total daily dose of 2000 mg/m^2 (1000 mg/m^2 twice daily 12 hours apart). If tolerability criteria were met for a subject capecitabine dose was escalated to 2500 mg/m^2 total daily dose (1250 mg/m^2 twice daily) and sorafenib dose to a total daily dose of 800 mg for that subject.,Placebo tablets matching with sorafenib were administered orally continuously (1 tablet in the morning 2 tablets in the evening) in a 3-week cycle. Capecitabine was administered orally at a total daily dose of 2000 mg/m^2 (1000 mg/m^2 twice daily 12 hours apart). If tolerability criteria were met for a subject capecitabine dose was escalated to 2500 mg/m^2 total daily dose (1250 mg/m^2 twice daily) and placebo dose to a total daily dose of 4 tablets (2 tablets twice daily) for that subject.

Efficacy Evaluation of TheraSphere to Treat Inoperable Liver Cancer With Blockage of the Portal Vein(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01887717)
 ,TheraSphere,Sorafenib
 ,Participants received TheraSphere at a dose consistent with the approved package insert to the treated lobe of the liver. TheraSphere was administered through the hepatic artery. The targeted dose was 120 Gy + 10%. Dose reduction to a minimum dose of 80 Gy + 10% was permitted to manage radiation exposure to the lungs. Re-treatment of the same participant/lobe with further cycles of TheraSphere was permitted if a treatable progression was detected during follow-up evaluations. Any re-treatment took place at least 28 days after the previous TheraSphere treatment administered to that lobe. Participants could receive a subsequent TheraSphere administration in the absence of radiological progression criteria at the Investigator's discretion. A maximum of 3 TheraSphere administrations was permitted.,Participants received sorafenib oral tablets 400 milligrams (mg) twice daily in accordance with the package insert. Treatment was to continue until the participant was no longer clinically benefiting from therapy or until unacceptable toxicity occurred. Medically appropriate dose adjustments and drug holidays due to adverse events (AEs) and toxicity were allowed.

Universal Granulocyte Macrophage-colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF)-Producing and GM.CD40L for Autologous Tumor Vaccine in Mantle Cell Lymphoma(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00101101)
 ,Vaccine and Conventional Therapy
 ,Patients were treated with 3-6 cycles of chemotherapy +/- rituximab with type and duration at the discretion of the individual clinician.  Chemotherapy: 6 courses of cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) OR 3 courses of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide vincristine doxorubicin and dexamethasone alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine (hyper-CVAD) for patients who have relapsed after CHOP.  Patients who achieve a partial or complete response after completion of chemotherapy proceed to autologous tumor cell-based vaccine therapy.  Patients who have stable or responding disease at 12 months receive 4 additional courses of booster vaccine and low-dose IL-2.  Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

 ,Temsirolimus Plus Liposomal Doxorubicin
 ,Single arm consists of temsirolimus (Torisel) plus liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil). Temsirolimus is administered IV in sequentially escalating cohorts at doses between 15 and 50 mg/M2 (body surface area) once weekly. Liposomal doxorubicin is administered IV at 30 mg per M2 (body surface area) once every 28 days. Treatment may continue with both drugs for 2 years. Temsirolimus may continue beyond 2 years.  temsirolimus plus liposomal doxorubicin: Patients will be treated with temsirolimus (Torisel) temsirolimus weekly by iv and with liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) (standard dose) by iv once every 28 days. Cohorts of patients receive sequentially increasing dose of temsirolimus until maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Once MTD (standard dose) is achieved dosing will be with standard doses for each drug but dosing will be modified based on toxicity.

Safety and Efficacy Study of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody Plus CHOP For Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00992992)
 ,Iodine I-131 Tositumomab + CHOP
 ,Participants (par.) with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) were dosed with iodine I-131 tositumomab in two phases followed by six cycles (21 days per cycle) of cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine and prednisone (CHOP). In the first phase (dosimetric dose) par. received an infusion of unlabeled tositumomab (450 milligrams [mg]) over the course of 60 minutes followed by a 30-minute infusion of tositumomab (35 mg) containing 5 millicurie (mCi) of iodine-131. In the second phase (therapeutic dose) par. received a 60-minute infusion of tositumomab (450 mg) followed by a 30-minute infusion of 35 mg tositumomab containing a participant-specific dose of iodine-131. This dose was calculated based on the dosimetric dose results to deliver a total body radiation dose of 75 centigray (cGy).

BI 6727 (Volasertib) Randomised Trial in Ovarian Cancer(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01121406)
 ,Volasertib (BI 6727),Cytotoxic,Cytotoxic to Volasertib Switch
 ,Volasertib (BI 6727 300 mg) was administered as intravenous infusion over 2 hours at Day 1 of each 21-day treatment course.  Treatment was to be administered until disease progression or occurrence of toxicity leading to treatment discontinuation. Patients withdrawn from volasertib treatment could receive a treatment according to investigator's choice. The patients were to be followed for survival status.,Patients received a non-platinum cytotoxic single agent. The investigator chose the most appropriate drug according to patient status (previous chemotherapy effects cumulative toxic effects performance status and nutritional status) the product Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and the local standard of care. The following non-platinum regimens were recommended because they are regarded efficacious and safe in patients with resistant ovarian cancer:  Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD): 40 mg/m² at Day 1 (1 course = 28 days)  Topotecan: 1.25 mg/m² from Days 1 to 5 (1 course = 21 days) or 4 mg/m² at Days 1 8 and 15 (1 course = 28 days)  Paclitaxel: 80 mg/m² at Days 1 8 15 and 21 (1 course = 28 days)  Gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m² at Days 1 and 8 (1 course = 21 days),Patients of the cytotoxic arm who switched to treatment with Volasertib (BI 6727).

Doxorubicin-eluting LC Bead M1 for Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02007954)
 ,DEBDOX
 ,DEBDOX: DEBDOX loaded with doxorubicin is a device that utilizes beads in place of lipiodol to deliver the chemotherapy into the liver tumor. The device allows for continuous elution of doxorubicin into the liver tumor tissue. The advantages of this method of delivery in comparison to conventional TACE are that the beads are able to deliver a greater volume and concentration of the drugs to the tumor because of their unique ability to elute the drug over a period of several days. As a result of this unique delivery systemic toxicity is significantly reduced. The potential advantages of the smaller beads are deeper penetration into the tumor bed while avoiding premature proximal occlusion of vessels feeding the tumor and more consistent dosing. These properties translate into greater potency of therapy and potentially improved patient survival.

A Study of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine vs. Investigator's Choice of Chemotherapy in Women With Folate Receptor (FR) Alpha Positive Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC)  Primary Peritoneal or Fallopian Tube Cancer(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02631876)
 ,Mirvetuximab Soravtansine,Investigator's Choice (IC) Chemotherapy
 ,Participants received mirvetuximab soravtansine at 6 mg/kg AIBW administered IV on Day 1 of a 3 week cycle. Participants continued to receive study drug until they experienced PD per RECIST version 1.1 (as assessed by BIRC) experienced unacceptable toxicity or withdrew consent whichever came first or until the sponsor terminated the study. (Maximum exposure: 86.9 weeks),Participants received a dose of IC chemotherapeutic agent calculated using BSA. Paclitaxel administered at 80 mg/m^2 as a 1-hour IV infusion on Days 1 8 15 and 22 of a 4-week cycle; or topotecan administered at 4 mg/m^2 over 30 minutes on Days 1 8 and 15 of a 4-week cycle. Alternatively topotecan could have been administered at 1.25 mg/m^2 over 30 minutes on Days 1 to 5 of a 3-week cycle; or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin administered at 40 mg/m^2 as a 1 mg/minute IV infusion on Day 1 of a 4-week cycle. After Cycle 1 if tolerated pegylated liposomal doxorubicin could have been administered as a 1-hour infusion. Participants continued to receive study drug until they experienced PD per RECIST version 1.1 (as assessed by BIRC) experienced unacceptable toxicity or withdrew consent whichever came first or until the sponsor terminated the study.

 ,Treatment: Pembrolizumab and AVD Chemotherapy Guided by PET-CT
 ,All patients get 3 cycles (21-days each) of pembrolizumab (PEM) induction then a PET-CT (PET#2). PET#2 required for primary endpoint analysis. Patients evaluable for response assessment if they had at least one dose of PEM.  After all patients get 2 cycles (28-days each) of AVD (doxorubicin vinblastine dacarbazine) followed by an interim PET-CT (PET#3) for response analysis.  Depending on age stage and PET#3 results per Deauville (DV) Score patients get additional 2-4 cycles of AVD or AVD and escBEACOPP (escalated bleomycin etoposide doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine procarbazine prednisone) + radiotherapy (RT). Then patients will have a PET-CT (PET#4) or a CT (CT if Stage I/II disease and negative for PET#3).  Patients under 60 go to survival follow-up. Patients over 60 go to survival follow-up or 1-2 years of PEM consolidation based on bulky vs non bulky disease results of the PET#3 and the number of AVD cycles received.  See schema for details.

 ,HDIT and HCT
 ,Participants recv'd Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) by injection for 4-5 days to increase the number of blood stem cells in the blood stream by mobilizing them from the bone marrow. Leukapheresis was performed until > 2.0 x 10^6 CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) per kg were collected and frozen for future use. After ≥7 days following the last G-CSF dose patients were hospitalized and received high-dose immunosuppression (HDIT) and immunosuppressive agent thymoglobulin 2.5 mg/kg over the course of 6 days. HDIT consisted of carmustine 300mg/m^2 etoposide 200 mg/m^2 cytarabine 200 mg/m^2 and melphalan 140 mg/m^2. CD34+ HPCs were thawed and infused according to institutional best practice for blood component transfusion over approximately 30 minutes. Patients were hospitalized until recovery of ANC to > 500/uL for at least 2 days. Prednisone was administered (0.5 mg/kg/day) from Days 7 to 21 after HCT and tapered over 2 weeks to prevent engraftment syndrome.

 ,In the first-line treatment period participants received imatinib 400 mg orally once daily in the morning. Hydroxyurea was permitted in the first 6 months to keep the white blood cell count (WBC) below 20.0 X 10^9/liter. If protocol specific criteria applied participants were eligible to crossover to receive interferon-alpha (IFN-a) and cytarabine (ARA-C) in the second-line treatment period. Maximum study duration was 11.5 years.,In the first-line treatment period participants received interferon-alpha (IFN-a) subcutaneous (SC) injections escalated over 4 weeks to achieve a target dose of 5 MU/m^2/day. After the maximum tolerated dose of IFN-a was achieved participants also received cytarabine (ARA-C) 20 mg/m^2/day (max 40 mg) SC injections for 10 days every month. Hydroxyurea was permitted in the first 6 months to keep the white blood cell count (WBC) below 20.0 X 10^9/liter.

A Study to Determine the Efficacy of Lenalidomide Versus Investigator's Choice in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00875667)
 ,Lenalidomide,Investigator's Choice
 ,Participants received lenalidomide 25 mg capsules orally every day for 21 days of each 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants with moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 mL/min but < 60mL/min received 10 mg lenalidomide for 21 days of each 28-day cycle (Cycles 1 and 2). After Cycle 2 if the participant remained free of Grade 3 or Grade 4 toxicity the dose was increased to 15 mg lenalidomide for 21 days of each 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.,Participants received a single agent investigators choice (IC) of chlorambucil 40 mg/m^2 PO every 28 days until progressive disease (PD) or toxicity OR rituximab 375 mg/m^2 by intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 8 15 and 22 of each 56-day treatment cycle until PD or toxicity OR cytarabine 1-2 g/m^2 by IV infusion on days 1 and 2 of each 28 day treatment cycle; up to 6 cycles OR gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2 by IV infusion on days 1 8 and 15 of each 28 day treatment cycle; up to 6 cycles OR oral fludarabine 40 mg/m^2 or IV fludarabine 25 mg/m^2 on days 1 through 5 of each 28-day cycle; up to 6 cycles. Participants were given the option to enter into the lenalidomide crossover phase if PD occurred and received lenalidomide 25 mg capsules daily on days 1 to 21 of each 28 day treatment cycle until PD or toxicity.
