A Phase II Study of BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) in Metastatic  Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00090545)
 ,First Stage - Disease Progression,Second Stage - Increased Accrual
 ,The first stage was to rule out the probability of 4 month progression free survival. Patients were given 400 mg BAY 43-9006 orally twice daily in 28 day cycles.,Due to prostatic specific antigen and radiographic discordance during the first stage the protocol was amended to allow accrual to a second stage. 400 mg BAY 43-9006 orally twice daily in 28 day cycles.

 ,BAY 43-9006 & Cetuximab
 ,BAY 43-9006: Administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice a day (BID) BAY 43-9006: is a potent inhibitor of proto-oncogene c-Raf (c-raf) and wild-type and mutant proto-oncogene b-Raf (b-raf) in vitro. Cetuximab will be given intravenously (IV) at a dose of 400 mg/m^2 initially as a loading dose on week 2 followed by 250 mg/m^2 weekly starting on week 3. Cetuximab is a recombinant human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody which binds specifically to the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (HER1) c-ErbB) in normal and tumor cells and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands such as transforming growth factor-alpha.

Sorafenib for Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Esophageal and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00917462)
 ,Sorafenib
 ,Sorafenib for patients with metastatic or recurrent esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer. Sorafenib administered orally: Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily administered continuously. Patients will continue on treatment until progression of disease. Each cycle consists of 28 days. The cycle start date will coincide with the physician visit date. Because of the potential need for physician visit scheduling to vary (due to both physician and patient issues) to avoid violation of and deviation from the protocol these visits may vary by up to one to fourteen (1-14) days. A study diary will be completed by patients to ensure compliance with the study drug.

Depocyt® With Sorafenib in Neoplastic Meningitis(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00964743)
 ,Intrathecal DepoCyt and Oral Sorafenib
 ,This is a single arm pilot study. Investigators planned to enroll approximately 10 patients to receive concurrent intrathecal DepoCyt and oral Sorafenib. DepoCyt: through a reservoir every 2 weeks for 5 doses then every 4 weeks for an additional 5 doses (a total of 10 DepoCyt treatments). Oral Sorafenib: at 400 mg twice a day throughout the treatment course until disease progression or death.
Total serious adverse events,2/2 %100.0
Death not associated with CTCAE term - Death not otherwise specified (NOS),1/2 %50.0
Death not associated with CTCAE term - Disease progression not otherwise specified (NOS),1/2 %50.0

Phase III Trial Comparing Capecitabine in Combination With Sorafenib or Placebo in the Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic HER2-Negative Breast Cancer(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01234337)
 ,Sorafenib (Nexavar BAY43-9006) + Capecitabine,Placebo + Capecitabine
 ,Sorafenib tablets were administered orally continuously at a total daily dose of 600 mg (200 mg in the morning 400 mg in the evening) in a 3-week cycle. Capecitabine was administered orally at a total daily dose of 2000 mg/m^2 (1000 mg/m^2 twice daily 12 hours apart). If tolerability criteria were met for a subject capecitabine dose was escalated to 2500 mg/m^2 total daily dose (1250 mg/m^2 twice daily) and sorafenib dose to a total daily dose of 800 mg for that subject.,Placebo tablets matching with sorafenib were administered orally continuously (1 tablet in the morning 2 tablets in the evening) in a 3-week cycle. Capecitabine was administered orally at a total daily dose of 2000 mg/m^2 (1000 mg/m^2 twice daily 12 hours apart). If tolerability criteria were met for a subject capecitabine dose was escalated to 2500 mg/m^2 total daily dose (1250 mg/m^2 twice daily) and placebo dose to a total daily dose of 4 tablets (2 tablets twice daily) for that subject.

TRC105 for Liver Cancer That Has Not Responded to Sorafenib(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01375569)
 ,TRC105 in Liver Cancer
 ,TRC105 is an experimental cancer drug designed to slow or stop the growth of tumors. It does this by preventing the growth of new blood vessels that feed these tumors. This drug is being used to test the safety and effectiveness to treat liver cancer that has not responded to standard therapy. TRC105 will be given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks.

Efficacy Evaluation of TheraSphere to Treat Inoperable Liver Cancer With Blockage of the Portal Vein(https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01887717)
 ,TheraSphere,Sorafenib
 ,Participants received TheraSphere at a dose consistent with the approved package insert to the treated lobe of the liver. TheraSphere was administered through the hepatic artery. The targeted dose was 120 Gy + 10%. Dose reduction to a minimum dose of 80 Gy + 10% was permitted to manage radiation exposure to the lungs. Re-treatment of the same participant/lobe with further cycles of TheraSphere was permitted if a treatable progression was detected during follow-up evaluations. Any re-treatment took place at least 28 days after the previous TheraSphere treatment administered to that lobe. Participants could receive a subsequent TheraSphere administration in the absence of radiological progression criteria at the Investigator's discretion. A maximum of 3 TheraSphere administrations was permitted.,Participants received sorafenib oral tablets 400 milligrams (mg) twice daily in accordance with the package insert. Treatment was to continue until the participant was no longer clinically benefiting from therapy or until unacceptable toxicity occurred. Medically appropriate dose adjustments and drug holidays due to adverse events (AEs) and toxicity were allowed.
