NCT00090545-1,First Stage - Disease Progression,Description: The first stage was to rule out the probability of 4 month progression free survival. Patients were given 400 mg BAY 43-9006 orally twice daily in 28 day cycles.
NCT00090545-2,Second Stage - Increased Accrual,Description: Due to prostatic specific antigen and radiographic discordance during the first stage the protocol was amended to allow accrual to a second stage. 400 mg BAY 43-9006 orally twice daily in 28 day cycles.

Cetuximab will be given intravenously (IV) at a dose of 400 mg/m^2 initially as a loading dose on week 2 followed by 250 mg/m^2 weekly starting on week 3. Cetuximab is a recombinant human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody which binds specifically to the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (HER1) c-ErbB) in normal and tumor cells and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands such as transforming growth factor-alpha.

NCT01887717,Efficacy Evaluation of TheraSphere to Treat Inoperable Liver Cancer With Blockage of the Portal Vein,
NCT01887717-1,TheraSphere,Description: Participants received TheraSphere at a dose consistent with the approved package insert to the treated lobe of the liver. TheraSphere was administered through the hepatic artery. The targeted dose was 120 Gy + 10%. Dose reduction to a minimum dose of 80 Gy + 10% was permitted to manage radiation exposure to the lungs. Re-treatment of the same participant/lobe with further cycles of TheraSphere was permitted if a treatable progression was detected during follow-up evaluations.

NCT00101101-1,Vaccine and Conventional Therapy,Description: Patients were treated with 3-6 cycles of chemotherapy +/- rituximab with type and duration at the discretion of the individual clinician.  Chemotherapy: 6 courses of cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) OR 3 courses of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide vincristine doxorubicin and dexamethasone alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine (hyper-CVAD) for patients who have relapsed after CHOP.  Patients who achieve a partial or complete response after completion of chemotherapy proceed to autologous tumor cell-based vaccine therapy.  Patients who have stable or responding disease at 12 months receive 4 additional courses of booster vaccine and low-dose IL-2.  Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

NCT02007954,Doxorubicin-eluting LC Bead M1 for Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma,
NCT02007954-1,DEBDOX,Description: DEBDOX: DEBDOX loaded with doxorubicin is a device that utilizes beads in place of lipiodol to deliver the chemotherapy into the liver tumor. The device allows for continuous elution of doxorubicin into the liver tumor tissue. The advantages of this method of delivery in comparison to conventional TACE are that the beads are able to deliver a greater volume and concentration of the drugs to the tumor because of their unique ability to elute the drug over a period of several days. As a result of this unique delivery systemic toxicity is significantly reduced. The potential advantages of the smaller beads are deeper penetration into the tumor bed while avoiding premature proximal occlusion of vessels feeding the tumor and more consistent dosing. These properties translate into greater potency of therapy and potentially improved patient survival.

After all patients get 2 cycles (28-days each) of AVD (doxorubicin vinblastine dacarbazine) followed by an interim PET-CT (PET#3) for response analysis.  Depending on age stage and PET#3 results per Deauville (DV) Score patients get additional 2-4 cycles of AVD or AVD and escBEACOPP (escalated bleomycin etoposide doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine procarbazine prednisone) + radiotherapy (RT). Then patients will have a PET-CT (PET#4) or a CT (CT if Stage I/II disease and negative for PET#3).  Patients under 60 go to survival follow-up. Patients over 60 go to survival follow-up or 1-2 years of PEM consolidation based on bulky vs non bulky disease results of the PET#3 and the number of AVD cycles received.  See schema for details.
